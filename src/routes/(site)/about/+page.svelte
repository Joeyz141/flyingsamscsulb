                <p>
                    The Flying Samaritans is a completely student-run organization, driven by the passion and dedication of future healthcare professionals 
                    at CSULB. We take pride in providing essential medical services to underserved communities, empowering our members to step into leadership roles 
                    and gain invaluable real-world experience. We run everything from the ground up—our students are 100% in charge of every aspect, from fundraising 
                    efforts to organizing the logistics of each clinic we operate. This means that we meticulously manage the inventory, keeping track of all 
                    medications and supplies needed to ensure that every clinic runs smoothly and effectively. Our commitment doesn’t stop at planning and organizing; 
                    it extends to personally contributing to our cause. Every donation that supports our clinics often comes directly from our students’ closets or 
                    their own pockets. Whether it's medical supplies, basic necessities, or financial contributions, our members are the backbone of our operations, 
                    showcasing a level of dedication that goes beyond the typical student organization. This hands-on involvement teaches us not only the practical 
                    skills needed in healthcare but also instills a profound sense of responsibility and compassion. It’s through these efforts that we are able to 
                    make a tangible impact in the communities we serve, providing much-needed care while growing as future healthcare professionals.

                <p>
                    We are part of a larger national organization that spans various university chapters, all working towards the common goal of making healthcare 
                    accessible to those in need. Our chapter is dedicated to upholding the values of compassion, service, and community involvement that define 
                    the Flying Samaritans mission.

                <p>
                    Our general meetings are held monthly on the first Monday of each month at 7pm, where we plan our clinics, discuss upcoming events, learn from 
                    a diverse group of medical professionals and mentors, and collaborate on projects. These meetings are essential for staying connected and 
                    informed about our ongoing initiatives.

                <h2 class="section-title">Our Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    i.) We aim to expand our services by adding optometry and dentistry to our monthly clinics, addressing the growing needs of our community. 
                    Additionally, we are committed to upgrading our clinic site to enhance the quality of care and accommodate more patients. These improvements 
                    will allow us to offer comprehensive care and improve patient outcomes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ii.) We are also looking to partner with a growing number of sponsors with aligned values as the Flying Samaritans of Long Beach.
